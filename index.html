    <p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.</p>
    <p>
      HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext
      defines <br />
      the link between the web pages. A markup language is used to define the
      text <br />
      document within tag which defines the structure of web pages. This
      language <br />
      is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine
      can <br />
      understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g.
      HTML)<br />
      are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has
      to be <br />
      done on the text.
